- Restaurant is named as such because it represents the runnable for the program.
  It deals with thread creation and starting.
- Chef is named as such because the class represents a Chef thread.
- Agent is named as such because the class represents an Agent thread.
- BoundedBuffer is named as such because the class represents a BoundedBuffer.
  As covered and explained in class.
